# My-Radar

By Th√©ophile Combes.

This project aims to render a 2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic.
We have 2 entities, plane and tower. A plane has a start position, a destination, a velocity, and a spawn timer. A tower has a radius.
If two planes collide, they are destroyed. But if they collide inside the radius of the tower they are free to go.

This is one of my first projects, this is why the code architecture is meh.
